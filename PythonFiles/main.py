# _____________________________________________________
# RULES
# 1. ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will pick an element on the Periodic Table.
# 2. You will have to guess the Atomic Number of that Element (ranging from 1 to 118).
# 3. ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will tell you whether the number is too small or too large.
# 4. If you guess a number you already guessed, ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will notify you on that.  But he will still count that as an attempt.
# 5. The process repeats until you guess the number.
# 6. Or until ''' + Clyde.name + ''' gets too tired and tells you to stop.
# 7. As you know, ''' + Clyde.name + ''' doesn\'t have all day.
# 8. Meaning if you can't guess correctly after 60 tries, ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will give up on you and reveal the answer.
# 9. Finally, ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will give you your score based on your performances.
# 10. And you can decided to play again or stop playing the game entirely.
