WELCOME!!! To my...
Number Guessing Game of the Elements of the Periodic Table 

Here are the rules...''')
Clyde.Print('''
_____________________________________________________
RULES
1. ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will pick an element on the Periodic Table.
2. You will have to guess the Atomic Number of that Element (ranging from 1 to 118).
3. ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will tell you whether the number is too small or too large.
4. If you guess a number you already guessed, ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will notify you on that.  But he will still count that as an attempt.
5. The process repeats until you guess the number.
6. Or until ''' + Clyde.name + ''' gets too tired and tells you to stop.
7. As you know, ''' + Clyde.name + ''' doesn\'t have all day.
8. Meaning if you can't guess correctly after 59 tries, ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will give up on you and reveal the answer.
9. Finally, ''' + Clyde.name + ''' will give you your score based on your performances.
10. And you can decided to play again or stop playing the game entirely.
