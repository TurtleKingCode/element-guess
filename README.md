By-weekly Challenge 2:  I'm making a number guessing game based on the elements of The Periodic Table
# How it works
1. You will meet Clyde.
2. Clyde will introduce himself. And interact with you.
3. Afterwards,  Clyde will pick a number from 1 - 118.
	a. He picked an element on the Periodic Table.
4. You will have to guess that numberhe picked.
5. Clyde will tell you whether your number was too big or too small.
6. However, just because Clyde is a robot doesn't mean he has all day.
7. Clyde has feelings too and he gets tired too.
7. After 59 tries, Clyde will stop you and tell you the answer.
8. Clyde also has a point system and will give you a score at the end of the game based on your performance
