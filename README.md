# element-guess
By-weekly Challenge 2:  I'm making a number guessing game based on the elements of The Periodic Table
# How it works
1. You will meet Clyde.
2. Clyde will introduce himself. And interact with you.
3. Afterwards,  Clyde will pick a number from 1 - 118.<br>
	a. He picked an element on the Periodic Table.
4. You will have to guess that numberhe picked.
5. Clyde will tell you whether your number was too big or too small.
6. However, just because Clyde is a robot doesn't mean he has all day.
7. Clyde has feelings too and he gets tired too.
8. After 59 tries, Clyde will stop you and tell you the answer.
9. Clyde also has a point system and will give you a score at the end of the game based on your performance
# How To Run Code
My project here has a ton of folders and files, so I need to explay what you need in order to be able to run the Code.
1. Do't pay attention to `.replit` file.  That file tells Repl.it what to do when I press the "Run" Button.
2. Pay Attention to the `PythonFiles` folder because it is where I stored all my important Python Files.
3. Once you get there, you will see another folder titled `__pycache__`.  I don't know what the point of that folder is.
4. I assume that the folder was added by Repl.it when I transfered my repository there.
5. Anyways, nothing there is important to me... All you have to pay attention are the three files below it
6. Those being...<br>
	a.`main.py`: Which is where the front of my progrom is.  You have to run this file not the others.<br>
	b.`Reponces.py`: This is where I stored all the functionality of the Code.  Where the game was set up, and it contains the code that runs Clyde<br>
	c.`Elem.py`: This is where I stored all the Elements of the Periodic table, and their information.
<br>

If you want to run the Code from Repl.it instead... use this link:
